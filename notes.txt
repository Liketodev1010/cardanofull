Weâ€™ll use the flask command to run the application but before that, we need to tell Flask how to load the application by specifying the FLASK_APP environment variable:

	export FLASK_APP=hello
	flask run

    If you installed Flask on a virtual machine and you want to access Flask development server then you can make the server publicly availabl    e by appending --host=0.0.0.0 to the flask run command.

Installing db:
	pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy

Database configurations:
	sqlite:////tmp/test.db
	mysql://username:password@server/db
